    <h3>Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
    <P>The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page
        session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
        created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>
    <h3>Difference between Block Scope and Global Scope?</h3>

    <h3>How many ways to find undefined in javascript?</h3>
    <p>In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an object property is undefined is to use the typeof
        operator.typeof returns a string that tells the type of the operand. It is used without parentheses, passing it
        any value you want to check.If the value is not defined, typeof returns the ‘undefined’ string.</p>
